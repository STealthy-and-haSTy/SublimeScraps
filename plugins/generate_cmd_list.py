#
# This plugin is a variation on the version referenced in the Stack Overflow
# answer above, and creates an output view in the current window that contains
# information on all commands currently known to Sublime (except commands in
# the core, which are not exposed for runtime introspection).
#
# The output splits the commands first by the package that they're defined in
# and then by their type. Each command is shown with arguments accepted,
# default values for arguments, and a description of the command if it is
# available.
#
# This information is gained via introspection and so it is potentially
# incomplete and subject to the whims of the developer that generated the
# command to a large degree.
#
# Something to note is that this won't pick up commands in the Sublime core
# as they're not implemented by direct plugin code and are thus not exposed via
# the mechanism that this plugin uses.
#
# It should also be noted that not all commands defined by packages are meant
# to be used by the user directly in any meaningful capacity, but this plugin
# has no way of differentiating those from "normal" commands
